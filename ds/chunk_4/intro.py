# Python Conditions and If statements\n
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:\n

    Equals: ```a == b```\n
    Not Equals: ```a != b```\n
    Less than: ```a < b```\n
    Less than or equal to: ```a <= b```\n
    Greater than: ```a > b```\n
    Greater than or equal to: ```a >= b```\n
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.\n

# Python For Loops\n
A ```for``` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).\n

This is less like the ```for``` keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.\n

With the ```for``` loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.\n

# The ```while``` Loop
With the ```while``` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```
# Print i as long as i is less than 6:

i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```
