# Python Classes/Objects\n
`ds.chunk_5.python_class`\n
Python is an object oriented programming language.\n

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.\n

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.\n
# Python Functions\n
`ds.chunk_5.function`\n
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.\n

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.\n

A function can return data as a result.\n
