# Lists\n
`ds.chunk_3.list`\n
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.\n
Lists are created using square brackets:\n
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```
# Tuples\n
`ds.chunk_3.tuples`\n
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n
Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.\n
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.\n
Tuples are written with round brackets.\n
```
# Create a Tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
```
#Sets\n
`ds.chunk_3.sets`\n
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.\n
A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.\n
Sets are written with curly brackets.\n
```
# Create a Set:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
```
# Dictionary\n
`ds.chunk_3.dictionary`\n
```
thisdict = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}
```
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates.\n
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:\n
```
# Create and print a dictionary:
thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
```
